### Surface Book Kernel for Fedora 31

##### Rationale

I have been dual-booting my personal first-generation Microsoft Surface Book with linux for a few months and I recently switched to Fedora from Ubuntu. Ubuntu is more widely supported and an updated Linux kernel for Fedora is more difficult to come by. 

Thus, here are my compiled RPMs based on the Linux-Surface [https://github.com/linux-surface] repo. 

Thus, these RPMs may may include **newer version of the Linux kernal** than what is within the repositories. 

Enjoy!
